[Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) is a framework for writing and executing high level descriptions of your software’s functionality. Call these tests, examples, specifications, whatever… it doesn’t matter too much. What I’m talking about has traditionally been called functional, integration, and/or system tests. In XP terms this includes tests called Story Tests, Customer Tests, and/or Acceptance Tests.

One of Cucumber’s most compelling features is that it provides the ability to write these descriptions using plain text in your native language. Cucumber’s language, Gherkin, is usable in a growing variety of human languages, including [LOLZ](http://lolcode.com/). The advantage of this is that these feature descriptions can be written and/or understood by non-technical people involved in the project.

One important thing to keep in mind is that Cucumber is NOT a replacement for RSpec, test/unit, etc. It is not a low level testing/specification framework.

Cucumber plays a central role in a development approach called [Behaviour Driven Development](http://behaviour-driven.org/) (BDD).
